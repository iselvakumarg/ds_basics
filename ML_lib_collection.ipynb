        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**sklearn**--  It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**numpy**--  adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "**scipy**-- used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing\n",
        "\n",
        "**matplotlib**-- plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.\n",
        "\n",
        "**pandas**-- for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series\n",
        "\n",
        "**torch**-- used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing\n",
        "\n",
        "**seaborn**-- Seaborn is a library for making statistical infographics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and also supports numpy and pandas data structures. It also supports statistical units from SciPy\n",
        "\n",
        "**wordcloud** --  cloud filled with lots of words in different sizes, which represent the frequency or the importance of each word. This is called Tag Cloud or WordCloud\n",
        "\n",
        "**bs4** -- Basic purpose of building beautifulsoup is to parse HTML or XML documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**requests** -- The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data\n",
        "\n",
        "**theano** -- Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. It is built on top of NumPy. Theano features: tight integration with NumPy: a similar interface to NumPy’s. numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in Theano-compiled functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**networkx** -- for studying graphs and networks\n",
        "\n",
        "**cv2** --designed to solve computer vision problems. It works and process the images.\n",
        "\n",
        "**gym** --  provides an easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks. We provide the environment; you provide the algorithm. You can write your agent using your existing numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano."
